      <description>The objective of this paper is two-fold. Firstly I develop a tractable general equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous agents facing financial constraints and endogenous evolution of entrepreneurial productivity. The key mechanism I explore is the interaction between growth, self-financing and misallocation. Consider an economy with underdeveloped financial system with the presence of severe financial frictions which distorts the allocation of capital across agents. This static misallocation acts as a tax on growth, because there are two competing forces that individuals are facing.</description>
