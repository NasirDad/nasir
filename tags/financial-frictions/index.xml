      <description>Why do living standards differ so much across countries? Across time and space, we observe large differences in income per capita across countries. Factor difference between richest and poorest deciles of the income distribution are of 20 folds in 1960 to more than 50 fold in 2014. A natural question arises, what accounts for the large differences in income per capita across countries? The literature subscribes to productivity (TFP) in accounting for bulk of the differences in income per capita across countries.</description>

      <description>The objective of this paper is two-fold. Firstly I develop a tractable general equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous agents facing financial constraints and endogenous evolution of entrepreneurial productivity. The key mechanism I explore is the interaction between growth, self-financing and misallocation. Consider an economy with underdeveloped financial system with the presence of severe financial frictions which distorts the allocation of capital across agents. This static misallocation acts as a tax on growth, because there are two competing forces that individuals are facing.</description>
